/* Features:
   - transaction-centric operation
   - only hardware SPI (SPI, MOSI and MISO pins are shared for lcd and touchscreen)
   - write function 8 and 16bit without DMA or with DMA (in both fill and bitmap mode)
   - write function with bitdepth convert (16bit RGB565 to 24bit RGB888) without DMA or with DMA
   - all writing functions are possible in both fill and bitmap mode
   - read function 8 and 16bit without DMA or with DMA
   - read function with bitdepth convert (24bit RGB888 to 16bit RGB565) without DMA or with DMA */

/* In dma mode the bitmap drawing function is completed before the actual drawing.
   When should we wait for the previous DMA operation to complete?
   - 0: The transaction function returns immediately after starting the fill or bitmap draw using DMA. 
        At the beginning of the function, it checks whether the DMA is still working on a previous drawing, 
        if so it waits until it is finished. This is the fastest drawing method, 
        but care must be taken not to change the content of the bitmap after starting the bitmap drawing, 
        because it may result in an incorrect drawing.
   - 1: When drawing a bitmap, the transaction function waits for the end of the drawing, 
        if it fills, it returns immediately after starting the DMA. 
        At the beginning of the function, it checks whether the DMA is still working on a previous drawing, 
        if so it waits until it is finished. 
        With this setting, there will be no errors in drawing under any circumstances. This is the default mode.
   - 2: At the end of each transaction, it waits until the drawing is finished. 
        It is recommended to choose this when using Freertos, other tasks may run while waiting */
